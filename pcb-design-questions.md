#Schematic Review  
###Is LDR a photodiode?
- No photodiodes have a faster switching time as compared to LDR.
- LDR is bidirectional where as photodiode is uni directional
- Photodiode is 1 or 0 where LDR is resistance based on amount of light
- LDR is used in street lights while photodiodes are used in spectrometer

###What is the diference between schotty diode and diode?  
- Schotty diode provides faster switching times
- Schotty diode has far lower forward voltage drop

###What is zener diode?  
- Normally a diode breaks down with high reverse voltage
- Zener diode works perfectly in the breakdown region  

###What is BJT transistor?  
- It stands for bipolar junction transistor
- There an NPN and PNP transistor
- Used as amplifier and swtich  

###Are their any unipolar junction transistors?  
- Yes they were called field-effect transistors

###What is conventional current?  
- Direction in which positive charges will flow

###What is a depletion layer in a transistor?  
- Natural boundry that forms due to electrons and holes when the material is doped

###What is doping?  
- Doping is the intentional addition of impurities to intrinsic semicondutctor
- The doped material is called extrinsic semiconductor

###What is a MOSFET?  
- MOSFET stands for Metal Oxiode SemiConductor Field Effect Transistor
- BJT has base emiiter and collector MOSET has gate source and drain
- BJT is preffered for low current applications and MOSFET is preferred for high power connections
- The operation of MOSFET depends on the voltage at gate where as operation of transistor depend on the current in the base

###How do you design not gate using and gate?  





###What is the truth table of XOR?



###What is the truth table for XNOR?


###What the units used for:
- Resistor: Ohm
- Capactior: Farad
- Inductor: Henry

###What is a PTC?
PTC is a resettable fuse using polmeric temperature coffienent. Itâ€™s resistance increases as the temperature increases

###What are nets in a schematic?
Nets are connection list in a schematic

###What are junctions and nodes?
- When a wire splits into two or more wires we call it a node. In schematic it is denoted by a dot which is called a node. 
- We would usually want the wires in a schematic not cross each other. But in the situation where it does cross and is unaviodable we use the nodes.

###What are netnames?
-Each net can be assigned a name, which can later on be used in the schematic to connect nets to a pin without the drawing the wire. This can be done by tagging.
Nets are usually named for the purpose it is being used.

#PCB  

###What is a perf board?  

###What is the composition of PCB?  

###What is FR4?  
- FR4 is a high temperature plastic like material which is non conductive. 
- Usually the boards used are 1.8mm but some other boards are 0.8mm as well.  

###Why is PCB green?  
- Beacause of the solder mask

###What is silk screen?
- Silk screen is the white on which we label our PC  

##SOME TERMINOLOGIES TO REMEMBER   
- Annular rings: Ring of copper plated around a through hole
- DRC: Design Check rules
- Drill hits: places of pcb where hold should be drilled. Inaccurate drill hits are the most common manufacturing issue.
- Finger: exposed metal pads to connect one circuit to another
- Mouse bites: number of small drill holes closely done to remove a pcb from a pannel
- Pad: a portion of exponsed metal on the surface where component is soldered
- Panel: a large board consisting of other smaller boards
- Paste stencil: a thin metal plate placed on top of the pcb to apply solder paste on specific areas  for assembly of components
- Plane: continous  block on copper defined by border rather than by parts
- Plated through hole: annular ring with a via
- Reflow process: melting the older to create joints between board and components
- Solder mask: used to prevent short circuiting 
- Traces
- V-score partial cut through the board allowing easy snapping
- Via a hole in the via used to pass signal form one layer to another.
